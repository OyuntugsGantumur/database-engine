## Database-engine

This project aims to implement a small database engine that creates tables, inserts/updates information to the table, and selects the specified data from the database. 
- The database can store four data types (smallint, integer, char(n), and varchar(n)).
- Conditional inequalities (=, !=, <, >) were implemented for select and update statements. 
- The "*" operation can also be used for select statements.
- For insert and update statements, the primary key constraint is reinforced so that no two rows can have the same primary key value.
